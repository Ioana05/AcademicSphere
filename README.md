# 🧑‍🏫 AcademicSphere: university organizational hub

This comprehensive database is used for managing all facets of university operations, offering a structured and efficient approach to administrative tasks, academic planning, and community engagement. 
It encompasses a wide array of tables, each designed to capture specific aspects of university life. 

Such tables can be queried to answer requirements such as:

- select the average admission grade of students who are enrolled in the same specialization and who attend at least one course of the teacher with the most experience (*ex. 11*)
- select the first name, last name and the specialization of the first three students, who are attending the same specialization with the highest admission grade of all students (*ex. 15*)
- select each university its name and the total number of people who participated in all the events organized by the student associations from the faculties; the result will be displayed in ascending order according to the number of
participants, and if the number of participants is null, *"There are none" is displayed organized events within the university"*. (*ex. 15*)
